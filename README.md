# MNIST Digit Recognizer

## Introduction

This project is an implementation of a digit recognizer using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains handwritten digits and is widely used in the machine learning community to benchmark algorithms.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Convert the MNIST dataset into a usable format for training and validation.
- **Model Training**: Train a neural network (or another machine learning model) to recognize handwritten digits.
- **Evaluation**: Validate the model's performance using a test set.
- **User Interface**: A simple UI for users to draw digits and get predictions from the trained model.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - TensorFlow
   - Tkinter for the UI

2. **Installation**:
   \```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \```

3. **Running the Application**:
   \```bash
   python main.py
   \```

## Usage

1. Start the application.
2. Draw a digit in the provided canvas.
3. Click on "Predict" to get the model's prediction.
4. (Optional: any additional features, e.g., "Save the drawn image", "Clear the canvas", etc.)

## Model Details

- Architecture: (Provide details about the model's architecture, e.g., "A simple feedforward neural network with 2 hidden layers.")
- Training Epochs: (Provide the number of training epochs, e.g., "Trained for 50 epochs.")
- Performance: (Provide performance metrics, e.g., "Achieved 98% accuracy on the test set.")
